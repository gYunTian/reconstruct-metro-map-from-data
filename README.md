# reconstruct-metro-map-from-data
This Data Science Project seeks to reconstruct a Metro Map from a dataset that consists of many faulty and erroneous samples

Take-home test
### Introduction
You are provided with the following dataset:
mrt_trips_sampled.csv: A list of MRT train journeys on a particular day in Singapore.

Each line in the file consists of five fields: (a) a unique journey ID, (b) destination station, (c) time when the commuter exited the gantry, (d) origin station and (e) time when the commuter entered the gantry.

### Questions
Your task is to write programs to answer the following questions:

 1. What is the underlying MRT network according to the dataset provided? You should derive the network using only the dataset provided, without referring to other resources, such as the MRT network in Singapore from SMRT, Wikipedia, etc.

 2. Given an origin and destination station pair (e.g. Station A and Station B), how many trains travelled from Station A to Station B in the given dataset? You may refer to the actual MRT network from official sources.
 
 3. Suppose a commuter wants to board a train at Clementi Station at 9:25 am and alight at Kallang Station. Can you determine the number of people in the train at every station along the path from Clementi to Kallang starting from 9:25 am? You may refer to the actual MRT network from official sources.

Please complete this exercise within 7 days. If you need any clarification, please do not hesitate to contact us.

Some of these questions are <b>difficult</b>. Hence, it would be a good idea to break up the problem into easier sub-problems. If you are not able to solve the problem, do show us your plan of how to solve the problem, as well as any intermediate results and code you might have worked out.


### Deliverables
You may use any mode of presentation (e.g. Jupyter notebook or slides) to deliver the following:

1. Any code you wrote to answer the questions. We should be able to run your code, and it should complete within a reasonable runtime. Please provide instructions for running and using your code on our systems, assuming some level of technical proficiency.

2. Outline of your approach to the problems and results you obtained. Please include well-chosen charts to communicate data insights and messages as intuitively as possible.
You will need to walk us through this when you meet us for the face-to-face interview.

Please send the deliverables to @open.gov.sg within 7 days of receiving this email.
